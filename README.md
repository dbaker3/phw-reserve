# PHW Reserve
### Room Reservation WordPress Plugin

Authenticates users based on their email address domain. They must have an email account in your approved list of domains, e.g. _github.com_ or _milligan.edu_. This prevents spamming yet makes it simple to implement without needing user accounts. This design decision was made to meet the needs of an organization with a small number of email domains (our college campus) without the need to implement LDAP or other authentication methods.

Works with our _Today's Hours_ Wordpress plugin to make reservations available only during business hours.

#### CSS Classes

The following is the list of CSS classes used to define the layout of the reservation form. You will probably want to style these somewhere:
 - alert
 - fail
 - form
 - label
 - text
 - three-fourths
 - half
 - full
 - laylah
 - textarea
 - submit
